## Pathfinding robot in a maze[^1]

## How it works

- The robot **must always** begin from the left side (the left wall).

- The start line and the finish line are physically denoted by **two small black tapes** on the floor.

- The robot has four phases:

  1. Following the left wall from the **start** towards the **finish** line.
  2. Once arrived at the finish line, it stores the distance from the start line to the finish using **left wall**. It then continues its run along the same left wall.
  3. At the start line once again in stores the distance of the **right wall**.
  4. A last run is made following the **shortest wall** found towards the finish line.

## Structure of the code

  The code is modularized in 4 different modules that are connected through an header file with the main source as shown below
